					TypeScript Enums:
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
Enums come in two flavors string and numeric.An enum (short for enumeration) is used to define a set of named constant values.
👉 Instead of using magic numbers or strings, we use meaningful names.
					Numeric Enums - Default
By default, enums will initialize the first value to 0 and add 1 to each additional value:
enum CardinalDirections {
  North,
  East,
  South,
  West
};
let currentDirection = CardinalDirections.North;

// North is the first value so it logs '0'
console.log(currentDirection);

// throws error when commented in as 'North' is not a valid enum
// currentDirection = 'North'; 
// Error: "North" is not assignable to type 'CardinalDirections'.


					Numeric Enums - Fully Initialized:
You can assign unique number values for each enum value.
Then the values will not be incremented automatically:
enum StatusCodes {
  NotFound = 404,
  Success = 200,
  Accepted = 202,
  BadRequest = 400
};
// logs 404
console.log(StatusCodes.NotFound);
// logs 200
console.log(StatusCodes.Success);
					Numeric Enums - Initialized
You can set the value of the first numeric enum and have it auto increment from that:
enum CardinalDirections {
  North = 1,
  East,
  South,
  West
};

// logs 1 since we initialized the first value to something other than '0'
console.log(CardinalDirections.North);

// logs 4 as it continued on from the initial '1' value
console.log(CardinalDirections.West);

					String Enums
Enums can also contain strings.
This is more common than numeric enums, because of their readability and intent.
enum CardinalDirections {
  North = 'North',
  East = "East",
  South = "South",
  West = "West"
};

// logs "North"
console.log(CardinalDirections.North);

// logs "West"
console.log(CardinalDirections.West);
					Enum in function
enum OrderStatus {
  Placed,
  Shipped,
  Delivered
}

function trackOrder(status: OrderStatus) {
  if (status === OrderStatus.Delivered) {
    return "Order delivered";
  }
}
trackOrder(OrderStatus.Shipped);
					Enum in object
enum Theme {
  Light = "light",
  Dark = "dark"
}

type Settings = {
  theme: Theme;
};

const userSettings: Settings = {
  theme: Theme.Dark
};
